# EGR0D
 Python library `egr.py` based on CANTERA to simplify EGR simulations.
 This lib is based on CANTERA 2.6 : 
- simplified convergence configuration (no need to go through the residence time)
- more accesible variables (e.g. HRR) than in the 2.3 version
- a priori no strong compatibilty required with cantera-avbp
